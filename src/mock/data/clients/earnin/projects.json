      "problem": "EarnIn produces hundreds of ad variants weekly across Meta, Google, and TikTok but the manual creation process can't keep pace with the daily testing and optimization cycle.",
      "solution": "Build an AI-powered creative engine that generates performance ad variants at scale — static images, video clips, and search copy — trained on EarnIn's brand guidelines and top-performing historical ads.",
      "goal": "Reduce ad variant production time from 3 days to same-day delivery, enabling true daily A/B testing across all paid channels.",
      "why": "EarnIn's paid acquisition is their primary growth channel. Faster creative iteration means faster learning, lower CAC, and higher ROAS across $50M+ annual ad spend.",
      "technicalWorkflowScope": "Train image generation model on EarnIn brand assets, build copy generation pipeline for search/display, create multi-format export system (Meta, Google Display, TikTok), develop A/B variant automation",
      "dataRequirements": "2+ years of ad creative with performance data (CTR, CVR, CPA), brand guidelines, app screenshots, approved copy library, product feature descriptions",
